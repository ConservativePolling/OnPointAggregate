  - All users can comment when logged in
  - Clearly distinguished from reporter comments

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

The frontend UI needs to be updated to connect all these backend features. The system is designed to be:

2. **Clean** - No clutter, professional appearance
3. **Interactive** - Likes, replies, and comments update live
4. **Secure** - Admin-only features properly restricted
5. **Fast** - Optimistic UI updates, real-time polling

## Technical Notes

- **Authentication**: Netlify Identity JWT tokens
- **Storage**: In-memory (resets on function cold start - acceptable for demo)
- **Real-time**: 5-second polling for comment updates
- **Admin Email**: jaydenmdavis2008@outlook.com
